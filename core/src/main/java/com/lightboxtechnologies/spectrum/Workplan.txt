Things to be done for extraction:

- Extract table names and other magic values to static variables -- done, mostly

- Open the extents file in setup(), not in map()

- Pay attention to memory realloc to avoid garbage and gc pauses

- BytesWritable for key

- Use NSRL Bloom Filter to mark known files as "nsrl"

- Use KeyValueSortReducer and HFileOutputFormat for bulk write

- Compression in HBase; LZO or Snappy

- Compressed evidence files and json files

 - Refactor guts of reading extents into an InputStream class (use Joel's stream aggregator)
		In addition to being arguably cleaner, this could enable feasible use on a workstation in standalone mode.

 - Is there an HFileInputFormat that will let us read the hfiles before they're loaded in hbase?

 - Use Avro in FsEntry for static tsk fields

 - Write custom splitter/scheduler so that chunks without files don't get scheduled
 or
 - Alternately, for large fragmented files, mappers use append() to write fragments in order. Hoo-ah!

 - Slack

 - Alternate data streams

 - Revisit overwritten files
